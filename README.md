### NOTES ABOUT capstonefinal.py
The tkinter file selection dialogues may appear in your taskbar but not automatically open to your view. You will need to click on the file icon to open and interact with it. If the terminal appears to be loading when it should not, you may need to close an extra tkinter window sometimes created in order to progress in the program.

The current threshold for matching is .70 but making the threshold user inputted is a very easy fix [edit directly to main].
